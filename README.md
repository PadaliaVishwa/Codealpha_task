The project Network Sniffer is about Network Sniffing tool which is used to capture packets and analyze network traffic. 
This can be useful for network diagnostics, monitoring, and educational purposes.
I have used Scapy library in python which is used to capture packets, forge and decode packets and many more and
also need Npcap which is the Nmap Project's packet capture (and sending) library for Microsoft Windows.
and accordingly use this libraries in our code for desired results...
